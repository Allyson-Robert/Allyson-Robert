### Hi there 👋

I use GitHub for passion projects that I hope will be useful for others, for those interested in what I do, you can find my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allysonrobert/).

### 🔬 New Project: X-LAB Plotting Framework & GUI

I’ve recently published the first public version of my **X-LAB Plotting Framework** — a modular system for loading, processing, and visualising experimental data with custom device-specific plotters.
If you’re curious about scientific tooling, extensible GUIs, or PyQt-based workflows, you can now find the project here:

| **[X-LAB Plotting Manager](https://github.com/Allyson-Robert/X-LAB_Plotting_Manager)**                 | The main PyQt5 GUI, dataset manager, threading logic, and plotting orchestration.                                    |
| **[X-LAB Plotting Example Implementations](https://github.com/Allyson-Robert/X-LAB_Plotting_Example)** | A minimal but complete example showing how to implement custom data types, processors, plotters, and device workers. |

### Open Source Hardware Projects
I like to tinker, and even more I love to share what I create. Here are the projects I've shared so far.

But aparently, I also host a bunch of LaTeX templates.
I have also been invited three years in a row to host a LaTeX workshop at Hasselt University. 
You can find the course material [here](https://allyson-robert.github.io/filii-latex/)

Here is  handy dandy table showing the various templates and their use.

Maybe you will enjoy my dice game or json formatter.
Those are just toy projects I barely have any time to work on.
