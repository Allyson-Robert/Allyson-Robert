### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is mostly a list of a few passion projects I hope will be useful for others.
I am working on a GUI/framwork to manage scientific research data and custom plotting. This will be published here in the coming months as I am still working on the final refactor and some examples.

But aparently, I mainly host LaTeX templates.
I have also been invited three years in a row to host a LaTeX workshop at Hasselt University. 
You can find the course material [here](https://allyson-robert.github.io/filii-latex/)

Here is  handy dandy table showing the various templates and their use.

Those are just toy projects I barely have any time to work on.
