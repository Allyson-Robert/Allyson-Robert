### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Apparently I host LaTeX templates.
For physics student a [report template](https://github.com/Allyson-Robert/UHasselt_Physics_Report_Template) is available for lab reports and a [paper template](https://github.com/Allyson-Robert/UHasselt_Physics_Paper_Template) is available for those wishing to write their bachelor project in paper format.

Other templates are available for [personal notes](https://github.com/Allyson-Robert/UHasselt-Coursenotes-LaTeX-Template), [reports for the School for Education Studies](https://github.com/Allyson-Robert/UHasselt-Reports-LaTeX-Template), or [bachelor projects](https://github.com/Allyson-Robert/UHasselt_Master_Bachelor_Thesis_LaTeX_Template).
Note that these were all initially written for personal use and are therefore still need work before they can be translated to other institutions or faculties. 

Maybe you will enjoy my dice game or json formatter.
Those are just toy projects I barely have any time to work on.
